## Introduction

I want to make a portfolio website so people can see the projects I’ve made.

## Functional Requirements
* My skills should be presented and thinks I like to do in my free time like hobbies and work. 
* I want it to be a one-pager with a nav bar and when you click one of the tabs it scrolls down. 
* I’m going to add little tiles with one picture of each project and the title and when you click the picture a little popup comes up with more information about the project and a link to the project itself. 
* I also want to add an animated background just something clean like little bubbles or something like that that move when you scroll down. 
* I also want it to make responsive so u can use it on phone and pc.

Small things I’m going to add:
* A button to get back to the top
* Photos of me
* My socials
* Phone numbers
* Skills



# TDD
To achieve these things, I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript (GSAP library).

So I will install the GSAP library, so I can use it 

To challenge myself I’m going to use gsap because I’ve never used it before, and I want to learn it. I’m going to be working in Webstorm.

I want there to be a navigation bar, and I’m going to make it so when you click on a topic it scrolls down to that part.

I’m going to use a font size and a font family for the characters.

I want a hover effect that changes the colour of the background of the button.

I’m going to use png as file type for the images because I think that is the handiest thing to use.
