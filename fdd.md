* I also want to add an animated background just something clean like little bubbles or something like that that move when you scroll down.

# TDD
To achieve these things, I will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript (GSAP library).

So I will install the GSAP library, so I can use it 

To challenge myself I’m going to use gsap because I’ve never used it before, and I want to learn it. I’m going to be working in Webstorm.

I want there to be a navigation bar, and I’m going to make it so when you click on a topic it scrolls down to that part.

I’m going to use a font size and a font family for the characters.

I want a hover effect that changes the colour of the background of the button.

I’m going to use png as file type for the images because I think that is the handiest thing to use.
